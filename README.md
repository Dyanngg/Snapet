# Snapet

An iOS application aimed to provide a number-entering free, self adaptive, streamlined and smart expense tracking experience. Ideally, after a short period of usage (around a week or so for users who maintain consistent expense habits), once users upload new entries, Snapet should be intelligent enough to recognize expenses that has occurred before, auto-categorize these expenses and put them into place. 
<br />
